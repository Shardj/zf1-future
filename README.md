# -- Attention --

This is the new package we use for the fde project since php 8 update for zend framework.
We have pulled a fork from the original repository: https://github.com/Shardj/zf1-future

Our fork is located in Github: https://github.com/sasu-fgrp/zf1-future

We imported the forked repo into Gitlab: https://gitlab-next.fgrp.net/ext/zf1-future

By using repository mirroring, all changes in Gitlab are also transferred to the fork on Github.

If there are changes in the original repo that we also want to have in our project, this is how it works:

* Sync the changes within the Github project (https://github.com/sasu-fgrp/zf1-future) from the original project

* In the GITLAB project, run the following locally:
  * Set your upstream to the repository you forked from: 
   ```bash
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:sasu-fgrp/zf1-future.git
  ```
   * Then fetch all the branches including master from the original repository: 
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  ```
  * Merge this data in your local master branch:
  ```bash
  git merge upstream/master
   ```
  * Push the changes to your repository i.e. to origin/master:
  ```bash
  git push origin master
   ```

# Zend Framework 1 now for PHP 8.1!
### Classic ZF1 Reborn
Zend may have abandoned the original Zend Framework, but the global Zend Framework Community has not! Since Zend sentenced ZF1 to EOL, the Zend Framework community around the globe has continued to work and build on what we consider to be one of the best PHP frameworks of all time.
Framework is tested by users up to PHP version 8.1. Note, that with 8.2+ you can experience some incompatibilities.
